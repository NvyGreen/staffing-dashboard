# Staffing Dashboard
This project is a demo dashboard built for a staffing and workforce management company. The application is designed to streamline day-to-day operations by providing managers with a centralized interface to manage clients, job requests, employees, and financial workflows.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how a single, intuitive system can support the full staffing lifecycle—from client intake and employee assignment to invoicing and payment tracking—while improving visibility and operational efficiency.

This repository serves as a functional prototype and proof of concept rather than a production-ready system.
